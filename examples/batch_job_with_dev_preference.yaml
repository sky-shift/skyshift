# Placement preference example using matching label
# stanza.
#
# Placement preference for this job is on clusters 
# labeled "purpose": "dev" (weight = 100), followed by 
# clusters labeled "purpose": "staging" (weight = 2).
# Lastly if there are other clusters not annotated with 
# either of the two labels, the preference placement will 
# default as the lowest weight (weight = 1) and be the 
# least preferred cluster to run this job.  Note that 
# since there is no placement filter criteria defined, 
# no clusters are filtered out and all clusters defined 
# in the system are considered for job placement.
