# Placement filter example using expression
# evaluation stanza.
#
# This job will run on any clusters with 
# label key: "purpose" and label value: 
# "demo", "prod", "dev" or "exclusive".
# If there are no clusters annotated with 
# one of the defined label key/value
# combinations the job will queue until 
# a cluster annotated with one of the 
# defined key/values labels is enabled in
# the system.  The intent for this job is
# to only run on any demonstration, 
# production, development or exclusive 
# use clusters.
