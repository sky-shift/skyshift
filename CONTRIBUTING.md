## Contribution Guidelines

### Getting Started 

See first the [README](README.md), including directions for viewing the docs/.

### Issues

Please [search existing issues](https://github.com/sky-shift/skyshift/issues) before reporting a bug or requesting a feature. If none adequately captures the gap you identified, please [post a new issue](https://github.com/sky-shift/skyshift/issues/new) or Draft PR and link any related GitHub Issues you discovered. 

### Pull Requests & Code Reviews

To get started, checkout the branch you are building on (usually `main`), create a new branch e.g. `new-feat`, and make your changes. Before creating a PR with the target branch (e.g. `main`), make sure you have the latest changes to `main`, and are able to merge `main` into `new-feat`. Other than testing, you are ready to create a PR!

### Testing

After installation, run `pytest` from your local skyshift directory.
